# upwardfind

Another small shell library that, given a path and a glob, finds the file or
directory that matches the glob in the nearest parent directory. Useful for
finding a project configuration file when creating a tool or something like
that. This is probably very niche, but I wanted to write a test script for my
own implementation, which you can find and try here. The current version has a
few 'forgotten' edge cases. I want to stop shaving this yak and finish it when
I have nothing better to do.

## Usage

Well, if you want to use this, you can probably just look at the code. If you
want an example of better documentation, just look at any one of my other
projects. Sorry.
